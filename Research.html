								<h3>1. Developing chemical reprogramming method for brain repair</h3>
								<h4>Advisor: Dr. Gong Chen</h4>
								<p>According to a report of the world health organization, neurological diseases, including brain injuries, neurodegenerative diseases, stroke and so forth, affect up to one billion people all over the world. Not only does the economic cost lay a big burden to the society, but the physical and mental sufferings to patients and their families are also considerable. People with brain injury or neurodegenerative diseases will suffer neuronal loss, which is the leading cause of symptoms of brain injury or neuredegenrative diseases. Producing functional neurons, therefore, is a promising method for brain repair. However, stem cell transplantation encounters tumor formation, aberrant differentiation and immune rejection. Direct in vivo reprogramming is considered to be a promising method for brain repair. </p>
								<p>After functional neuronal loss, astrocytes, NG2 cells and microglia will proliferate to reactively respond to brain injury. The reactive astrocytes are able to form glial scar to prevent the injury from spreading to surrounding healthy area, while the glial scar will inhibit information transmission at the same time. Research in our lab is to reprogram reactive astrocytes to functional neurons. Transcription factor <a href="http://www.cell.com/cell-stem-cell/abstract/S1934-5909(13)00550-X/">NeuroD1</a></Li> has been proved to be able to reprogram both human and mouse astrocytes into functional neurons. However, transcription factors rely on virus as the delivery system. My research focuses on small molecues to reprogram astrocytes into functional neurons.

								<h3>2. Establishing the Three-Dimensional (3D) Structure of Corticotropin-Releasing Hormone (CRH) Neurons in Amygdala</h3>
								<h4>Advisor: Dr. Jiangning Zhou</h4>
								<p>During stress, activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis causes a release of glucocorticoids (e.g., corticosterone), which bind to glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) throughout the central nervous system(CNS) to alter behavior. The application of corticosterone on hippocampus and prefrontal cortex can inhibit HPA axis activation; however, hormonal stimulation of the amygdala promotes glucocorticoid release. This seemingly positive feedback causes my attention to the regulatory pathway of HPA axis by amygdala. I am really curious about which kind of specific neurons is responsible for such relationship. Previous study showed that depressed rats induced by chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS) presented a higher expression level of CRH in central amygdala(CeA), which demonstrated that CRH might play a role in this regulator pathway. Accordingly, my work is to construct the 3D structure of CRH neurons in amygdala. </p>
